Journal of Trust Management  (2015) 2:5 \nDOI 10.1186/s40493-015-0015-3\n\nRESEARCH Open Access\n\nReusable components for online reputation\nsystems\nJohannes Sänger*, Christian Richthammer and Günther Pernul\n\n*Correspondence:\njohannes.saenger@wiwi.\nuni-regensburg.de\nUniversity of Regensburg,\nUniversitätsstraße 31, 93053\nRegensburg, Germany\n\nAbstract\n\nReputation systems have been extensively explored in various disciplines and\napplication areas. A problem in this context is that the computation engines applied by\nmost reputation systems available are designed from scratch and rarely consider well\nestablished concepts and achievements made by others. Thus, approved models and\npromising approaches may get lost in the shuffle. In this work, we aim to foster reuse in\nrespect of trust and reputation systems by providing a hierarchical component\ntaxonomy of computation engines which serves as a natural framework for the design\nof new reputation systems. In order to assist the design process we, furthermore,\nprovide a component repository that contains design knowledge on both a\nconceptual and an implementation level. To evaluate our approach we conduct a\ndescriptive scenario-based analysis which shows that it has an obvious utility from a\npractical point of view. Matching the identified components and the properties of trust\nintroduced in literature, we finally show which properties of trust are widely covered by\ncommon models and which aspects have only rarely been considered so far.\n\nKeywords: Trust; Reputation; Reusability; Trust pattern\n\nIntroduction\nIn the last decade, trust and reputation have been extensively explored in various disci-\nplines and application areas...."

To showcase the flexibility of our design, we\nimplemented a prototype and evaluated three trust algorithms, namely EigenTrust,\nPeerTrust and Appleseed, for their vulnerabilites to attacks and compliance to various\ntrust properties. For example, we were able to exhibit discrepancies between\nEigenTrust and PeerTrust, as well as trade-offs between resistance to slandering attacks\nversus self-promotion.\n\nKeywords: Trust testbed; Reputation; Multi-agent systems\n\nIntroduction\nMotivation\n\nWith the growth of online community-based systems such as peer-to-peer file-sharing\napplications, e-commerce and social networking websites, there is an increasing need to\nprovide computational trust mechanisms to determine which users or agents are honest\nand which ones are malicious. Many models calculate trust by relying on analyzing a\nhistory of interactions. The calculations can range from the simple averaging of ratings\non eBay to flow-based scores in the Advogato website. Thus for a researcher to evaluate\nand compare his or her latest model against existing ones, a comprehensive test tool is\nneeded. However, our research shows that the tools that exist to assist researchers are not\nflexible enough to include different trust models and their evaluations. Moreover, these\ntools use their own set of application-dependent metrics to evaluate a reputation system.\nThis means that a number of trust models cannot be evaluated for vulnerabilities against\ncertain types of attacks. Thus, there is still a need for a generic testbed to evaluate and\ncompare computational trust models.\n\nOverview of our solution and contributions\n\nIn this paper, we present a model and a testbed for evaluating a family of trust algo-\nrithms that rely on past transactions between agents. Trust assessment is viewed as a\nprocess consisting of a succession of graph transformations, where the agents form the\nvertices of the graph. The meaning of the edges depends on the transformation stage,\n\n© 2015 Chandrasekaran and Esfandiari.
