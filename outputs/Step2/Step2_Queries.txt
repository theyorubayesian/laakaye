Using Azure Machine Learning’s MLOps capabilities, students will gain experience in understanding their ML models, protecting people and their data, and controlling the end-to-end ML lifecycle at scale. Gain practical experience by using the built-in Azure labs accessible inside the Udacity classroom and run complex machine learning tasks for no additional cost. ",

Thereby, a wide range of metrics and computation methods\nfor reputation-based trust has been proposed. While most common systems have been\nintroduced in e-commerce, such as eBay’s reputation system [1] that allows to rate sell-\ners and buyers, considerable research has also been done in the context of peer-to-peer\nnetworks, mobile ad hoc networks, social networks or ensuring data accuracy, relevance\nand quality in several environments [2]. Computation methods applied range from sim-\nple arithmetic over statistical approaches up to graph-based models involving multiple\nfactors such as context information, propagation or personal preferences. A general prob-\nlem is that most of the newly introduced trust and reputation models use computation\nmethods that are designed from scratch and rely on one novel idea which could lead to\nbetter solutions [3]. Only a few authors build on proposals of others. Therefore, approved\nmodels and promising approaches may get lost in the shuffle.\nIn this work, we aim to encourage reuse in the development of reputation systems by\n\nproviding a framework for creating reputation systems based on reusable components.\nDesign approaches for reuse have been given much attention in the software engineering\n\n© 2015 Sänger et al.;..."
